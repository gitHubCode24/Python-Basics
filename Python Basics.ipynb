What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   - Python is high-level, interpreted language known for its simple syntax, large standard library, and versatility. It's easy to learn, supports multiple programming paradigms.\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - The interpreter is a program that read and execute Python code line-by-line, and converting into machine code indirectly.\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - Keywords which are reserved words that have special meaning in Python (e.g. if, else, for, while, print).\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No! Python will throw a SyntaxError if you try.\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Mutability refers to whether an object can be changes after creation.\n","     - Mutable: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets\n","     - Immutable: Tuples, Strings, Integers\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - Lists store references in dynamic memory structure and Tuples are stored in fixed memory structures, so their contents can't change.\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   - == --> Checks value equality, is --> Checks object identity (where two variables point to the same object in memory)\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","   - and --> True if both are true, or --> True if at least one is True, not --> Inverts the boolean value.\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   - Converting one date type to another (e.g. int(\"5\") --> 5).\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","    - Implicit automatically converts types and Explicit manually convert.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - They allow decision-making - executing certain code only if conditions are met.\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - Used when you have multiple conditions. Python checks each in order until one is True.\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - for loops over a sequence or range (known iteration count), while loops until a condition is false (unknow iteration count)\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","    - repeatedly asking for a password until it's correct - you don't know how many attempts the user will take."],"metadata":{"id":"mwjXOf_ndVl6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Answers"],"metadata":{"id":"anM9jfkIfZOe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
